- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcos Cruz
- 👀 I’m interested in all TI field I think, but,
 machine learning and all possibilities
 in JS make my eyes shine *.* .

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vanilla JS.
I think we need to start from the beginning and I choose 
Js because I think that's gives you a lot of possibilities.
That's absolutely amazing.
At now I'm doing the base in Vanilla and, my plans are to understand 
And touch at least, all that crazy stuff ( react, node, next, jQuery, vue) 

My focus area will be back end

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can hehe

- 📫 How to reach me ...
