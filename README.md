- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcos Cruz
- 👀 I’m interested in all .Net Platform JS and AI tech. More specifically in this moment in C# and .Net Core..

- 🌱 I’m currently learning About creation of Api, WPF WFA and Entity Framework. 
I think we need to start from the beginning and I choose .Net because I think that's gives you a lot of possibilities. 
Start with a solid Language Near of C and Java will give you some bagage to Learn Everything.
That's absolutely amazing.

My focus area will be Back End

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can hehe
