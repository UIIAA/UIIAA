- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcos Cruz
- 👀 I’m interested in all .Net Platform more specifically in this moment in C# and .Net Core with all Famous FrameWorks..

- 🌱 I’m currently learning About creation of Api and Entity Framework. 
I think we need to start from the beginning and I choose 
.Net because I think that's gives you a lot of possibilities.
That's absolutely amazing.
At now I'm doing the base but my plans are to understand 
And touch at least, all that crazy stuff ( react, node, next, jQuery, vue) 

My focus area will be back end

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can hehe
